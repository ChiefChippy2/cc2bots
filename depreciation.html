<u><h1>Depreciations</h1></u>
<b>Why do we depreciate commands</b><br>
<p>There are multiple reasons as to why we depreciate commands. First and for all, the techniques used to make the command work might be depreciated, or inefficient. As much as we would like to maintain it, bad user experience or simply irresponsive APIs aren't acceptable. Another reason might be the lack of usage. Each command is maintained, and it takes lots of efforts to maintain a huge number of commands. To give priority and more enhancements to the most used commands, less used ones must be left behind and sometimes disabled. We understand it might be a huge loss for you, and we are deeply sorry, but quality over quantity, and unfortunately, not every command can survive.</p><br>
<b>Recent Potential Depreciation : leaderboard series</b><br>
<p>According to staff members of mineplex, the mechanic used to fetch leaderboards present on mineplex statisticker and <a href='/mpleaderboard'>this page</a> will be removed in a forseeable future. Sadly, at the moment being, it is quite clear there will be no alternative to it. This means that these commands will either 1.) use outdated leaderboards ( you know, like frozen in time ones ), or 2.) disappear entirely ( just poof, gone. ). There is no tellig as to what we will do until the day the mechanic fails.</p><br>
