<p>Mineplex Statisticker is a bot I created for, well, fetching mineplex player's stats. See description :</p><br>
    <p>I am a bot. <br> <i>What do I do?</i><br> §Well, I fetch stats from mineplex and report them to you<br> <i>Isn't there a similar bot like me?</i><br> §What? No. Never heard of that. No, for real, I will explain why I am better, alright? <br> <i>Features</i><br> I use an optimized code, which makes stats fetching extremely efficient. I can fetch the statistics of almost anyone that has ever played on Mineplex.<br> Here, let me also give you my commands : <br> <b><i>FOR LATEST INFORMATION, COMMAND USAGES, AND OTHER BOT-RELATED STUFF : PLEASE DO /? or /help</i></b> /?<br> /help<br> /inv link<br> /stats <[user]> <game><br> /leaderboard <game> <type> <b>Still in Beta</b><br> /uptime<br> /joke<br> /server <serverIP><br> /link<br> /ping mp<br> Oh : For any feedback/help, feel free to DM the bot via /feedback <message>. I will respond as soon as possible ( Note this command is subjected to a rate limit of 5 per day ) <br> ... And that is it.<br> ( Last Updated Today )</p>
